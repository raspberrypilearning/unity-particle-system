Particle Systems use lots of small images to create graphical effects that make a 3D world come alive. 

Click in the Inspector and choose 'Effects' -> 'Particle System' to add a particle effect to your world. You can also add a Particle System as a child of another GameObject if that makes sense. 

There are lots of settings you can experiment with to get different particle effects. 

Try adjusting these settings:
+ **Start Color** - Click on the colour to choose the colour for your particles. 
+ **Start Speed** - Control how fast your particles move. 
+ **Start Size** - Control the size of each particle. 
+ **Gravity Modifier** - Set to a positive number if you want your particles to fall to the ground. 
+ **Shape** - Controls the shape that particles appear from. The default is a Cone shape but it might make more sense for your particles to appear in a Sphere or a Cube area. 
+ **Max Particles** - The maximum number of particles that will be active at the same time. 

<mark>It would be good if we could include some specific examples such as snow, smoke, volcano erupting.</mark>
